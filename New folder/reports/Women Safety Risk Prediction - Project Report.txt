# Women Safety Risk Prediction - Project Report

## 1. Project Overview
Ensuring women's safety in urban areas is a critical social concern. 
This project aims to predict the risk level (Low, Medium, High) of different urban zones 
based on historical incident data, environmental factors, and time-based patterns.

## 2. Dataset
- **Rows:** 5000 synthetic records
- **Columns / Features:**
  - area_type: Residential, Commercial, Public
  - time_of_day: Morning, Evening, Night
  - day_of_week: Weekday, Weekend
  - past_incidents: Number of past incidents
  - police_presence: Low, Medium, High
  - lighting: Poor, Average, Good
  - crowd_density: Low, Medium, High
- **Target Variable:** risk_level (0=Low, 1=Medium, 2=High)

## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized feature distributions using **bar plots, histograms, and boxplots**.
- Key insights:
  - Nighttime areas with Poor lighting and Low police presence → High risk
  - Past incidents positively correlate with higher risk
  - Residential areas during the day → mostly Low risk

## 4. Machine Learning Model
- **Model Used:** Random Forest Classifier
- **Preprocessing:**
  - Categorical features → One-Hot Encoding
  - Target → Label Encoding
- **Train/Test Split:** 80% / 20%
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** GridSearchCV (n_estimators, max_depth, min_samples_split)

### Model Performance
| Metric          | Low | Medium | High |
|-----------------|-----|--------|------|
| Precision       | 0.90| 0.88   | 0.87 |
| Recall          | 0.92| 0.85   | 0.88 |
| F1-score        | 0.91| 0.86   | 0.88 |
| **Accuracy**    | \multicolumn{3}{c}{0.89} |

- Confusion Matrix shows **balanced predictions** across all risk levels.

## 5. Model Saving
- Initial model saved as `women_safety_model.pkl`
- Tuned model saved as `women_safety_best_model.pkl`  
- Ready for deployment or real-time inference

## 6. Next Steps
- Deployment as **interactive web application** (Streamlit / Flask)  
- Expansion to city-specific datasets for more granularity  
- Continuous model retraining with live data to improve predictions
