# Women Safety Risk Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Problem Statement
Ensuring women's safety in urban environments is a major social challenge. 
This project aims to predict safety risk levels of different urban areas 
based on historical incidents, environmental factors, and time-based patterns.

## 🎯 Objective
To build a machine learning classification model that categorizes locations 
into Low, Medium, or High risk zones to support preventive safety measures.

## 🧠 Solution Approach
- Collected and prepared structured safety-related data
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Applied feature engineering and encoding techniques
- Trained supervised machine learning classification models
- Evaluated model performance using standard metrics

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔄 Machine Learning Workflow
1. Data Collection
2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
3. Feature Encoding
4. Train-Test Split
5. Model Training
6. Model Evaluation
7. Risk Level Prediction

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset contains 5000+ records representing multiple urban zones.
Key features include area type, time of day, past incident count, 
police presence, lighting conditions, and crowd density.
